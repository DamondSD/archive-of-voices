- 🧰 GUI interface for chatting, generating NPCs, and saving logs.

## 🔧 Developer Notes

- Uses `window.socketlib.registerModule(...)` for official compatibility
- Socket functions registered under `archive-of-voices`
- `executeAsGM(...)` used for player-to-GM journal updates

---

## 🧪 Debugging

- Use `/av-lite` in chat to verify GM socket registration.
- Watch the browser console for logs like:
  ```
  📥 Received test socket from PlayerName
  ✅ GM updated 'Memory Log' in Journal: Jaaris
  ```
