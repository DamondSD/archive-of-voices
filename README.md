## ✨ Features

- 📘 Automatically creates and maintains "Memory Logs" for each NPC.
- 🧠 NPC memory is stored in Journal Entries inside the **NPC Memories** folder.
- 📤 Players' questions and NPC responses are logged via SocketLib — even if the player isn't the GM.
- 🧪 Slash command `/av-lite` to test GM socket response.
- 🧰 GUI interface for chatting, generating NPCs, and saving logs.

2. Configure your **OpenAI API key** in Game Settings.
3. Press the 🤖 robot button in chat controls to open the GUI.
4. Select an NPC and ask a question, or generate a new NPC.

### 🔹 Memory Logs

- Create a journal named exactly like your NPC (e.g. `Jaaris`) inside a folder called `NPC Memories`
- All conversations are logged under a page titled `Memory Log`

---

## 🔧 Developer Notes

- Uses `window.socketlib.registerModule(...)` for official compatibility
- Socket functions registered under `archive-of-voices`
- `executeAsGM(...)` used for player-to-GM journal updates

---

## 🧪 Debugging

- Use `/av-lite` in chat to verify GM socket registration.
- Watch the browser console for logs like:
  ```
  📥 Received test socket from PlayerName
  ✅ GM updated 'Memory Log' in Journal: Jaaris
  ```
